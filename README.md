# Homepage of the COMPutational machine LEarning group 

We are based at the University of Edinburgh (UK) and at the Gran Sasso Science Institute (Italy)
The group's interests center around mathematical foundations and computational aspects of deep learning, data-driven methods for differential equations and dynamical systems, numerical linear algebra, spectral theory, optimization and their applications to machine learning, network science, and social science.

More informations on who we are can be found [here](https://num-gssi.github.io/) and [here](https://ftudisco.gitlab.io/team/)
