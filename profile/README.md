# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

## Welcome to the COMPiLE Group (COMPutational machine LEarning)  

We are a research group jointly based at the University of Edinburgh (UK) and the Gran Sasso Science Institute (Italy).  

Our work explores the intersection of mathematics, computation, and machine learning. Specifically, we focus on:  
- Mathematical foundations and computational aspects of deep learning  
- Data-driven methods for differential equations and dynamical systems  
- Numerical linear algebra, spectral theory, and optimization  
- Applications in network science and social science
